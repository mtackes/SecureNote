### Project Problem Statement and Plan

Hi Michael, your Secure Note application sounds like it meets the individual project requirements and should provide an engaging challenge for you! Your objectives and timeline are on target, though the schedule could use more detail (see below). 

* A couple other tasks that should be included: design database, create database, add test data, weekly status report/blog/wiki, implement web service, create presentation materials, etc. 

* What web service/s are you planning to use? 


Looking forward to seeing your progress through the semester; this will be an interesting one!
